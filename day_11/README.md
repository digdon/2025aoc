#  Day 11: Reactor

Part 1 was pretty easy, of course - simple DFS through all of the nodes.

Part 2, of course, was much trickier. As you would expect, the paths are too long, so we need to use memoization. I worked that out nearly immediately but, as usual, I wasn't able to correctly work out the cache key. I don't know why I can't seem to figure these things out. Anyway, hit up a colleague's solution to see what key structure they used. Annoying that I knew the tool to use, but couldn't figure out how to use it.
